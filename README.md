# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Applied Capstone Project

This is a part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate: https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science

The project aims to to predict the landing of the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket with a high level of accuracy:
  - We collect data, as much and relevant as possible from various sources (Webscraping, API)
  - After raw data has been collected, we need to improve the quality by performing data wrangling
  - We start exploring the processed data using SQL, visualizations (Folium) and basic statistical analysis
  - We'll drill down by splitting the data into groups defined by categorical variables or factors in the data
  - We build, evaluate, and refine predictive models for discovering more exciting insights

The final task of this capstone project is to create a presentation based on the outcomes of all tasks in previous modules and labs.
